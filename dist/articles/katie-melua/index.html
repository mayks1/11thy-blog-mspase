                <h4>Katie Melua</h4>
<p>In November 2003, at the age of 19, Melua released her first album, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Off_the_Search" title="Call Off the Search">Call Off the Search</a></em>, which reached the top of the United Kingdom album charts and sold 1.8 million copies in its first five months of release.</p>

<p>Melua has been referred to as an '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline_junkie" title="Adrenaline junkie">adrenaline junkie</a>' because she enjoys  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster" title="Roller coaster">roller coasters</a>  and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funfair" title="Funfair">funfairs</a>  and often  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragliding" title="Paragliding">paraglides</a>  and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_gliding" title="Hang gliding">hang glides</a>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-27)  She has  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachuting" title="Parachuting">skydived</a>  four times and taken several  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator" title="Aviator">flying lessons</a>, and in 2004 she was lowered from a 200-metre (660 ft) building in New Zealand at 60 mph (97 km/h). When asked about Melua being an 'adrenaline junkie', Mike Batt said, &quot;she enjoys extremes, but in life her emotions are always in check&quot;. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-The_hitman_and_her-6)  In November 2009, Melua nearly drowned while diving in a lake near  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport" title="Heathrow Airport">Heathrow Airport</a>. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-28)</p>
<p>In September 2010, Melua was ordered by her doctors to stop working for a few months after suffering a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_breakdown" title="Mental breakdown">nervous breakdown</a>, resulting in her hospitalisation for six weeks. As a result, all touring and promotional activities were postponed until the following year.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-29)</p>
<p>Melua opened up about the breakdown years later in an interview with  <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></em>, saying that it ended up being one of the best things that had ever happened to her, as she said it helped to quash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. &quot;....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch of things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved around you and it doesn't.&quot;(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-30)</p>
<p>In January 2012, Melua confirmed her  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement" title="Engagement">engagement</a>  to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbike_World_Championship" title="Superbike World Championship">World Superbike</a>  racer and musician  [James Toseland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Toseland &quot;James Toseland&quot; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua#cite_note-31)  The couple married on 1 September 2012 in the Nash Conservatory at the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Botanic_Gardens,_Kew" title="Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew">Royal Botanic Gardens</a>  in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kew" title="Kew">Kew</a>, southwest London.
